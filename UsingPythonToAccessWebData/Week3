Socket library - traveling through internet gates

1 - We'll work on communication between 2 applications
  at the beginning we won't use internet and links

2- TCP connections are called SOCKETS
  Sockets are endpoints foi a bidirectional communication flow across the internet
  App built on the internet to make communications

3 - Ports work as phone numbers to reach applications in a different domain. They relate with different applications

4 - Ports that we use in this course: 80 (web server) 443 (secure https)
  browser > host number/name > port > application
        other ports: 23 (login), 21 (sile transfer), 143/220/993 (mail retrieval)

5 - In python it takes 3 lines of code to get through the link, network, transport layer, internet, and a server on the other side of the internet

HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol
  http is the set of rules to allow browsers to retrieve web documents from servers over the internet. It connects servers and browsers
  for example:
  protocol - https://
  host - www.coursera.org
  document - /learn/python-network-data/lecture/3oes7/12-2-hypertext-transfer-protocol-http

  Everytime a user clicks on something on its browser, it clicks on an anchor tag with a href to switch to a new page
    that's a "GET" request, which get the document from the server as html file and the browser fomats it and display to the user.

  Flow - click > get request (browser) > web server port 80 > parse/ render
