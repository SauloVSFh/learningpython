#tuples seem list except they use parenthesis

#tuples are unmodifiable
    #better to store and access data
    #use less memory and hence are more efficient
    #for temporary variables, it's better using tuples than list

#when you pull data from a dictionary using dict.items() you get a list of tuples back

#tuples assingment
    #always need other tuples
